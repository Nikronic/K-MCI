# K-MCI
This is an implementation of K-MCI algorithm in python based on a study by (Ganesh Krishnasamy,Ganesh Krishnasamy Raveendran Paramesran; Raveendran Paramesran;2014)

All datasets are from UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache & Lichman, 2013). But Vowel dataset was removed from UCI machine learning repository so we downloaded from http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asjagath/ce434/vowel.html.<br>
<br>In article author mentioned we have 683 samples for Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Actually there are 699 samples but 16 of samples have missing data so in this implementation we remove all missing data in preprocessing step.
